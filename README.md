# STA-141-Final-Project

In this project, I investigated the data from the study done by Steinmetz et al. (2019). The study looked at four different mice across various sessions in which the mice were presented with visual stimuli and had to make a decision.

Based on the mouse's decision, the trial was categorized as a failure (feedback = -1) or success (feedback = 1). Using the data from the study, I attempted to find the optimal model to predict the outcome of a trial. 

To successfully run the code in the .Rmd file provided, make sure to download the `sessions.zip` and `test.zip` files containing the data from the study, unzip them to the location of your choice, and then update the working directory to your path to these files when loading in the sessions and test data. 

The sessions data is loaded in at the beginning of the **Exploratory Data Analysis** section whereas the test data is loaded in at the **Evaluate Optimal Model Against Test Data** section.
